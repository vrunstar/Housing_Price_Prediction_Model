# Housing Price Prediction Model

## Project Introduction

The **House Price Prediction** project is designed to predict housing prices using machine learning. By leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost, this project provides a complete pipeline for accurate price estimation.

## Overview

This project develops a model to predict house prices based on various features. Accurate price prediction is essential in real estate and finance, helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. The project uses machine learning techniques on a curated dataset to create a reliable prediction tool.

## Dataset Used

The project uses the **California Housing** dataset from Scikit-learn. Key features include:  

- House age  
- Number of rooms  
- Population  
- Median income  

The dataset is preprocessed using Pandas to ensure it is ready for analysis and modeling.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data processing and manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning algorithms and utilities  
- **XGBoost** – gradient boosting regression  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Load and clean the California Housing dataset.  
2. **Data Visualization:** Analyze distributions, correlations, and feature relationships using plots.  
3. **Train-Test Split:** Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation.  
4. **Model Building:** Train an XGBoost regression model to predict house prices.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate performance using R-squared and mean absolute error, and visualize predicted vs actual prices.  

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:  ```gh repo clone vrunstar/Housing_Price_Prediction_Model```
2. Install required libraries (skip if using Google Colab).
3. Open the notebook:  ```house.ipynb``` using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
4. Run the notebook cells in order.
